# 🌐 Server-Side Overview
The server-side of the JobFinder application is responsible for processing job-related data, managing user requests, and maintaining the core business logic. It is designed with scalability, modularity, and performance in mind, allowing for fast and reliable communication with multiple clients simultaneously.



Key Responsibilities
🧠 Request Handling: Receives and processes incoming client requests over TCP/IP sockets.

🔍 Advanced Job Search: Implements a custom string-matching algorithm to improve search accuracy and relevance beyond basic keyword matching.

🧱 Modular Design: Each feature (e.g., job searchn) is implemented as a separate module for easier maintenance and scalability.

🗃️ Data Management: Handles job postings, and application records using in-memory data structures or an optional database backend.
